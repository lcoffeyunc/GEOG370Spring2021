    <h1>Homework 9: Choropleth map</h1>
    <h2>Lauren Coffey</h2>
    <h3>For this map project I researched the number of home births proportional to the number of births per state. As seen in the map, there is a concentration of proportionally high births in the Pacific Northwest and a particularly low concentration in the Southeast. Since six states in the United States make it illegal for midwives to preside over home births (North Carolina, Illinois, Nebraska, Alabama, Iowa and South Dakota), we can expect to see the low numbers in these states. States that have home birth restrictions, like New Jersey, which does not allow midwives to practice at the home births of any woman who had ever had a C-section, also likely have low rates for this reason. Alabama, the state with the lowest number (28 home births per 10,000) until recently did not even allow midwifery to be a legal practice, likely contributing to its extremely low rate. I was interested in this topic since I have studied to be a doula (a holistic birthing support) and have an interest in women's health particularly relating to childbirth, especially after studying the malpractice and poor health conditions women face when giving birth in hospitals. </h3>
